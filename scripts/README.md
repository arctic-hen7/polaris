# Polaris Scripts

This folder contains a collection of scripts that use Polaris to achieve different scheduling-related goals. I use these scripts all the time in my own systems, though some of them are quite specific to my system. The most important of these is `display.py`, which provides a generic interface to display information from Polaris in the terminal in a user-friendly way. The others handle calendar exporting and common shortcuts.

I may incorporate the functionality of these scripts into the main Rust component of Polaris at any time.
