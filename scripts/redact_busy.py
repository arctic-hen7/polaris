# identifying information from them, removing the title, body, and location, and redacting
# subtasks recursively, leaving only timestamps and IDs intact. This is intended to be used
# on calendar events to produce a "busy calendar" that can be shared with others without
# revealing sensitive information about the user's schedule.
